                    Hey there! I'm Bea Rina Molar, straight from the coastal vibes of San Juan, 
                    Hilongos, Leyte. Living by the beach was great, but my real passion was 
                    diving into the world of futuristic tech! Even as a kid, I was fascinated by 
                    all the amazing possibilities that technology could offer.
                </p>
                <p>           
                    Right now, I'm focusing on being practical and honing my skills in web development. 
                    Gotta start somewhere, right? But deep down, Iâ€™ve got this big dream of working 
                    on a major tech innovation somedayâ€”something that can really make an impact. 
                    Just taking it one step at a time!
                </p>
                <h3>My valuess and beliefs??....://</h3>
                <p>Why do it today when you can do it tomorrow? (Itâ€™s all about pacing, right?) XD</p>
                <p>
                    I love and liked playing MOBA and other PvP games. 
                    My game sense? Well, let's just say Iâ€™m more into the fun part than the winning part ;))

                    Procrastination? Yeah, thatâ€™s pretty much my constant companion. 
                    But hey, we still get things doneâ€”eventually. Itâ€™s all about balancing the fun with the work 
                    (okay, maybe more fun sometimes, pero balance pa rin naman ðŸ˜…).
                </p>
